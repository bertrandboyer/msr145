# MSR145 dll wrapper

## What is the MSR145

The MSR145 is a mini data logger that records many measures like temperature, humidity, light 3-axis acceleration and more.
It comes from a application to read and export data. But this code allows you to access the real-time value from your own application.

## How to use.

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/brtrndb/msr145.git
```

This solutions includes the source files `Msr145.h` `Msr145.cpp` and the `main.cpp` for testing.
To use it, include both files in your project.

## Notes.

There is probably some bugs and certainly many optimisations to do. But I don't have the sensor anymore, so I can't work on it.
